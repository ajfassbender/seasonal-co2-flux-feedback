# seasonal-co2-flux-feedback
This repository contains MATLAB code used to process, analyze, and visualize surface fields from the GFDL ESM2M large ensemble (30 members plus control run) to evaluate how changing sea surface carbon dioxide partial pressure influences ocean carbon uptake through 2100 under RCP8.5 forcing.  Model output files used in this analysis can be accessed here: http://poseidon.princeton.edu/

The accompanying manuscript for this work is presently under review at Global Biogeochemical Cycles: A. J. Fassbender, S. Schlunegger, K. B. Rodgers, J. P. Dunne. Quantifying the role of seasonality in the marine carbon cycle feedback: an ESM2M case study.
